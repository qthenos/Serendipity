Project Blurb: Our project is a comprehensive app designed to help users track their food and exercise data throughout the day, providing them with a centralized platform 
to monitor their health and fitness journey. The app allows users to log the meals they eat, the calories consumed, and the exercises they complete, offering a clear 
picture of their daily activities. In addition, it includes features for setting personalized goals and tracking progress over time, enabling users to stay motivated and 
focused on achieving a healthy lifestyle. With its user-friendly interface and insightful visualizations, the app serves as a valuable tool for promoting balanced eating 
habits and maintaining steady progress toward fitness goals.
